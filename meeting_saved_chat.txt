20:19:58 From Abdullah to Everyone:
	Pandas is usually imported under the pd alias. alias: In Python alias are an alternate name for referring to the same thing. Create an alias with the as keyword while importing: import pandas as pd. Now the Pandas package can be referred to as pd instead of pandas .
